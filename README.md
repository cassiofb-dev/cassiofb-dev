## Hello everyone, Cassio here!

I'm a brazilian CS student that loves everything about astronomy, math and programming!

[Lyrics](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/):

> Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
> Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
> Simple is better than complex.<br>
> Complex is better than complicated.<br>
> Flat is better than nested.<br>
> Sparse is better than dense.<br>
> Readability counts.<br>
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
> Although practicality beats purity.<br>
> Errors should never pass silently.<br>
> Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
> Now is better than never.<br>
> Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
